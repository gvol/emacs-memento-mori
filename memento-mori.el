;;; Commentary:

;; Shows your age in the global mode line as a reminder to squander less
;; of your brief time on this earth.
;;
;; Your age is shown with two decimal places so you can witness it
;; increasing every 3-4 days.  People commonly regard themselves as N
;; years old until the day they turn N+1 years old.  The decimals remind
;; you that this is a false comfort: many N-year-olds are already closer
;; to being N+1 years old.

;;; Usage:

;; Add something like the following (adjusting the date accordingly) to your
;; init.el.  If you have already set `memento-mori-birth-date', but not set
;; `memento-mori-mementos', then it will continue to work just providing your
;; age.  However, it's strongly encouraged to customize `memento-mori-mementos'
;; since it is much more flexible and can provide better reminders that you will
;; die soon enough.

  "List of mementos, namely things that will remind you of your short time.

Each memento is a list, the first element of which is a format
string.  The rest is a plist, namely a list of alternating
key/value pairs.  The supported keys are

:until  A time specification indicating the memento will happen in
        the future.
:since  A time specification indicating the memento happened in
        the past.

:formula A lambda taking either one or two arguments, both of which are
        the number of days as a float.  The two argument case takes
        since and until for cases when you need both (such as
        calculating a percent).  The one argument case will pass the
        appropriate one based on whether `:since' or `:until' was set.

        This is useful when the reminder depends on something other than
        simple time intervals, such as the number of books you might
        read before you die.  The lambda can return an already formatted
        string, or a float which will then be formatted below.

One of `:until' or `:since' is required to determine the time
between now and the memento.

The format string understands the `format'-like substitution
sequences below.  They also support all the flags supported by
`format-spec', such as padding and truncating to a given width.

%y  The number of years truncated to an integer.
%Y  The number of years as a float.
%m  The number of months truncated to an integer.
%M  The number of months as a float.
%w  The number of weeks truncated to an integer.
%W  The number of weeks as a float.
%d  The number of days truncated to an integer.
%D  The number of days as a float.
%p  The percent passed between `:since' and `:until' truncated to an integer.
%P  The percent passed between `:since' and `:until' as a float.
%f  The result of the `:formula' truncated to an integer.
%F  The result of the `:formula' as a float.
%%  A literal percent sign.

As shown, most sequences have a upper case and a lower case
version.  The lower case versions are truncated to integers since
this is a common use case.  The upper case versions return a
float for full control, but will likely require a width or
precision specifier in practice, such as \"%.2Y\" to show the
number of years with two decimal points of precision."
