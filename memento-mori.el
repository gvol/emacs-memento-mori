;;; Commentary:

;; Shows your age in the global mode line as a reminder to squander less
;; of your brief time on this earth.
;;
;; Your age is shown with two decimal places so you can witness it
;; increasing every 3-4 days.  People commonly regard themselves as N
;; years old until the day they turn N+1 years old.  The decimals remind
;; you that this is a false comfort: many N-year-olds are already closer
;; to being N+1 years old.

;;; Usage:

;; Add something like the following (adjusting the date accordingly) to your
;; init.el.  If you have already set `memento-mori-birth-date', but not set
;; `memento-mori-mementos', then it will continue to work just providing your
;; age.  However, it's strongly encouraged to customize `memento-mori-mementos'
;; since it is much more flexible and can provide better reminders that you will
;; die soon enough.

  "List of mementos, namely things that will remind you of your mortality.

Each memento is a list, the first element of which is a format
string.  The rest is a plist, namely a list of alternating
key/value pairs.  The supported keys are

:until  A time specification indicating the memento will happen in
        the future.
:since  A time specification indicating the memento happened in
        the past.

:formula A lambda taking either one or two arguments, both of which are
        the number of days as a float.  The two argument case takes
        since and until for cases when you need both (such as
        calculating a percent).  The one argument case will pass the
        appropriate one based on whether `:since' or `:until' was set.

        This is useful when the reminder depends on something other than
        simple time intervals, such as the number of books you might
        read before you die.  The lambda can return an already formatted
        string, or a float which will then be formatted below.

One of `:until' or `:since' is required to determine the time
between now and the memento.

The format string understands the `format'-like substitution
sequences below.  They also support all the flags supported by
`format-spec', such as padding and truncating to a given width.

%y  The number of years truncated to an integer.
%Y  The number of years as a float.
%m  The number of months truncated to an integer.
%M  The number of months as a float.
%w  The number of weeks truncated to an integer.
%W  The number of weeks as a float.
%d  The number of days truncated to an integer.
%D  The number of days as a float.
%p  The percent passed between `:since' and `:until' truncated to an integer.
%P  The percent passed between `:since' and `:until' as a float.
%f  The result of the `:formula' truncated to an integer.
%F  The result of the `:formula' as a float.
%%  A literal percent sign.

As shown, most sequences have a upper case and a lower case version.
The lower case versions are truncated to integers since this is a common
use case.  The upper case versions return a float for full control, but
will likely require a width or precision specifier in practice.
Unfortunately, the width and precision specifiers behave like the
corresponding ones in format when applied to %s, so they define the
width in characters, not the number of decimal places.  Therefore,
\"%.5Y\" will show the number of years with two or three decimal points
of precision depending on if it's longer than 10 years or not."

    "Only those are fit to live who do not fear to die; and none are fit to die\nwho have shrunk from the joy of life and the duty of life. Both life and death\nare parts of the same Great Adventure.\n\t—Theodore Roosevelt"

    "Too busy with the crowded hour to fear to live or die.\n\t–Ralph Waldo Emerson"
    "What is death? A scary mask. Take it off – see, it doesn’t bite.\nEventually, body and soul will have to separate, just as they existed separately\nbefore we were born. So why be upset if it happens now? If it isn’t now, it’s later.\n\t—Epictetus"
    "What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things.\nFor example, death is nothing dreadful (or else it would have appeared dreadful\nto Socrates), but instead the judgment about death that it is dreadful—that is what\nis dreadful. So, when we are thwarted or upset or distressed, let us never blame\nsomeone else but rather ourselves, that is, our own judgments.\nAn uneducated person accuses others when he is doing badly; a partly educated\nperson accuses himself, an educated person accuses neither someone else nor himself.\n\t—Epictetus"
    "When a man comes to die,\nNo matter what his talents and influences and genius,\nIf he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him\nAnd his dying a cold horror.\n\t–John Steinbeck"
    "When the longest- and shortest-lived of us dies, their loss is precisely equal.\nFor the sole thing of which any of us can be deprived is the present,\nsince this is all we own, and nobody can lose what is not theirs.\n\t–Marcus Aurelius"
    "When the only thing left to do is die, then die well.\n\t—Phil Van Treuren"
    "When your time comes to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with\nfear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little\nmore time to live their lives over again in a different way.\nSing your death song, and die like a hero going home.\n\t–Tecumseh"
    "You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire.\n\t—Lucius Annaeus Seneca"
    "You may leave this life at any moment: have this possibility in your mind in\nall that you do or say or think.\n\t—Marcus Aurelius"
    "Your entire life only happens in this moment. The present moment is life itself.\nYet, people live as if the opposite were true and treat the present moment as a\nstepping stone to the next moment – a means to an end.\n\t–Eckhart Tolle")
